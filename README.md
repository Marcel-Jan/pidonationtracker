This is my Python code to display the gift amount I have gathered for Tour for Life 2025 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with Inky Impressions 7.3 e-ink display.

I use this for our sponsoring events where we collect sponsoring for the Daniel den Hoed Foundation, for cancer research. The display shows the people who donate the updated gift amount. The code has been updated to scrape the gift amount from [my personal sponsor page of Tour for Life]([http://example.com](https://supporta.com/lfqd/z0qpn9xqox)).
